-- Broaden DropBridge Realtime topic authorization to both device kinds.
--
-- The original policy (20260310113000) only authorized lectra_ipad device
-- topics. That is enough for Canvascope->Lectra wakes and for the iPad sender to
-- receive its own delivery confirmation. The Canvascope extension now also
-- subscribes to its own device topic for instant `file_drop` wakes, so its
-- canvascope_extension device must be authorizable too. Auth still requires the
-- topic's user to be the caller and the device to belong to that user.
